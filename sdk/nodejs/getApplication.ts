/**
 * Use this data source to access information about an existing Application within Azure Active Directory.
 *
 * > **NOTE:** If you're authenticating using a Service Principal then it must have permissions to both `Read and write all (or owned by) applications` and `Sign in and read user profile` within the `Windows Azure Active Directory` API.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 *
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as azuread from "@pulumi/azuread";
 *
 * const example = pulumi.output(azuread.getApplication({
 *     name: "My First AzureAD Application",
 * }, { async: true }));
 *
 * export const azureAdObjectId = example.id;
 * ```
